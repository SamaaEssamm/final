Descriptive appreciation points estimate the percentage of degree
Excellent 4.0 A %90 or more
3.7 A %85 - Less than 90 %
Very good 3.3 b+ 80 % - less than 85 %
3.0 B %75 - Less than 80 %
Good 2.7 b %70 - less than 75 %
2.3 C+ %65 - less than 70 %
Acceptable 2.0 C 60 - less than 65 %
Conditional acceptable 1.7 %55 - less than 60 %
1.3 D+ %50 % - less than 55 %
1.0 D %45 - less than 50 %
Zero F is less than 45%
The student is considered successful in the course if he gets at least an average of 1.0.
In the event that the student gets a conditional acceptable estimate, he must obtain a cumulative rate of more than 2.0, otherwise he will be placed under academic observation (see Article 17) and is exposed to the semester of the college.
for.Accounting the cumulative average
The GPA (GPA) is calculated as follows:
• The value of an estimate and a course (the points shown in the previous table) is struck in the number of hours approved for this course, so that we can obtain the number of points for the course of the course.
• Points and study courses in which the student registered is collected.
• The total points are divided into total
The hours registered for the student to get the cumulative rate as follows:
Total points
GPA =
Total registered watches
C.General appreciation account
The general estimate of the student is calculated based on the cumulative average according to the following table:
Descriptive appreciation, a modified cumulative estimate
